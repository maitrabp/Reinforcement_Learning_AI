# Reinforcement_Learning_AI
Duo-TeamProject:- AI- The agent aims to run many trials in order to obtain Q-value for each (state, action) pair and the optimal action at each state to reach the goal state. Agent finds the most optimal path using Reinforcement_Learning. Here we are conducting 20,000 trials only for the most optimal path/result. 

# Testing
 * For successful testing, you must have [Java] & [Java Development Kit] installed.
 * Run the app whether it is using Eclipse, Netbeans, or Visual Studio code or some other IDE.
 * The optimal result will show up on console after 20,000 trials are done. 
 * The result is generated based on the pre-coded grid. However, the algorithm runs accurately on all types of grid.
